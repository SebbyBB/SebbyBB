- I'm @Sebby_B_B, an energy engineer who is dabbling in the world of data science and machine learning for energy optimisation.
- Self-taught via online resources in data analysis with python, but have experience with matlab and python for embedded applications.

- I'm interested in building my knowledge on the development pipeline, data science and machine learning, and how these can be used to make the world more sustainable, particularly in the world of energy.
 
- Currently learning about data science packages and how to apply them. Also looking into SciPy for optimisation using linear models.

- Although somewhat new to the online community, I am eager to engage with anyone who wants to analyse energy data and help decarbonise the energy industry.

- Reach out to me on GitHub, although I can't promise I will respond quickly here.
